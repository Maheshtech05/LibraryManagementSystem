# Project Overview – Library Management System

## Project Title
**Library Management System (Java – Option 3: Advanced)**

## Project Description
The Library Management System is a **Java-based, menu-driven console application** developed to manage library operations efficiently.  
It allows librarians to manage **books and members**, handle **borrowing and returning of books**, track **due dates**, calculate **late fines**, and generate **overdue reports**.

This project follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and separation of concerns.

## Objectives
- To design a real-world library system using Java
- To apply OOP concepts in a practical application
- To manage book availability and member records
- To implement due date and fine calculation logic
- To generate reports for overdue books
- To create a clean, menu-driven user interface

---

## Project Version
**Option 3 – Advanced Version**

This version includes:
- Book and Member management
- Borrow and Return functionality
- Due date tracking
- Fine calculation for late returns
- Overdue books reporting
- Preloaded sample data for testing

---

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 11 or higher)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Java Collections (`ArrayList`)
- Java Date-Time API (`LocalDate`, `ChronoUnit`)

---

## System Architecture
The application is structured into multiple classes with clear responsibilities:

- **Book** – Stores book details and borrowing information
- **Member** – Stores member details and borrowed books
- **Library** – Manages books, members, and operations
- **ReportGenerator** – Generates overdue reports
- **LibrarySystem** – Main class with menu-driven interface

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation using private fields and public methods
- Collection handling using `ArrayList`
- Date and time handling using Java Time API
- Input handling and validation
- Modular and maintainable code design

---

## Conclusion
The Library Management System demonstrates a complete Java console application that closely resembles real-world library operations.  
It is suitable for **academic submissions**, **internship evaluations**, and **GitHub portfolios**, showcasing strong Java fundamentals and application design skills.
